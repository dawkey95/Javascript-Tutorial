### 01 - Color Flipper
This project renders a website that has a simple option and a hex option. 
The 'simple' option renders the background color of the page from a array of preset colors. 
The 'hex' option is a bit more complicated in that is will set the background color to a randomly generated hex color code when the button is clicked.
